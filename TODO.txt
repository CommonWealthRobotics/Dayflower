GPU Renderer Bug:

	Description:

		The image sometimes resets when rendering with the Ambient Occlusion and Path Tracer algorithms. This does not seem to happen with the Ray Caster algorithm.
		It happens more often when the image is smaller than if it is larger.

Scene Loader Parameter Selection:

	Description:

		Create a general purpose API for parameter selection. One implementation of the API could be a GUI dialog box.
		It should support parameters of type boolean, float, int and String, as well as default values for these types.
		It should also support options, where a list of options are supplied and only one can be selected.
		An API like this would be useful in combination with a SceneLoader, such that parameters could be retrieved when generating a Scene.

	Status:

		An early version of the API now exists.
