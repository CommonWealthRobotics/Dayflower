Image Undo & Redo Functionality:

	Description:

		Add support for Undo and Redo operations to the ImageD and ImageF classes.

	Status:

		The methods setColorRGBA(Color4*, int, PixelOperation) and setColorRGBA(Color4*, int, int, PixelOperation) of ImageD and ImageF are now implemented in ImageD and ImageF, rather than their respective subclasses.
		The methods that performs the actual update are performed in putColorRGBA(Color4*, int) in their respective subclasses.
		This change is necessary, because ImageD and ImageF needs to collect the data that changes in some stack data structure.

Scene Loader Parameter Selection:

	Description:

		Create a general purpose API for parameter selection. One implementation of the API could be a GUI dialog box.
		It should support parameters of type boolean, float, int and String, as well as default values for these types.
		It should also support options, where a list of options are supplied and only one can be selected.
		An API like this would be useful in combination with a SceneLoader, such that parameters could be retrieved when generating a Scene.

	Status:

		An early version of the API now exists.
