Scene Loader Parameter Selection:

	Description:

		Create a general purpose API for parameter selection. One implementation of the API could be a GUI dialog box.
		It should support parameters of type boolean, float, int and String, as well as default values for these types.
		It should also support options, where a list of options are supplied and only one can be selected.
		An API like this would be useful in combination with a SceneLoader, such that parameters could be retrieved when generating a Scene.

	Status:

		An early version of the API now exists.
